What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a respository you are able to track and change the app using git. you can make commits as well.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where your changes go before they are fully saved to the repository, you are still able to go back and undo the changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use git diff to compare the latest commit to whats on your staging area.  if there is more than 1 logical change then you would know to not make that jsut one commit.

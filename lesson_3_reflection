when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when youd want whatever project your working on to be viewed and updated by the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to publicly show the changes your making, to whatever project your working on at that time.
